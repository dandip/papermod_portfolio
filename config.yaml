      >

      Hi there! Iâ€™m Dan.

      >

      I'm a researcher, computer scientist, and mathematician based out of
      New York City. I currently work at Jane Street Capital, a quantitative
      trading firm.

      >

      I really like building things--the entire process, from ideation to implementation.
      I think we have an obligation to leave the world better than we found it,
      and I believe my best way of doing so is through technological innovation and research.

      As of late, I've been most interested in non-convex optimization, computational physics,
      AI alignment, and natural language processing.

      >

      I consider myself a life-long learner--I read textbooks and research papers in my free time,
      and I'm making an effort to consolidate my notes [here](https://notes.isomorphic.group).
      I'm passionate about effective technical communication and writing; you can find my
      blog [here](https://isomorphic.group).

      >

      If you'd like to contact me, I can be reached at: `dan DOT dipietro DOT pub @ gmail DOT com`

      ## Software Projects

      >

      For detailed information on my software projects, please see the appropriate
      [page](/software). Most of my research has involved exciting and novel
      computational implementations; these are recorded on the [research page](/research).

      >
      * **Fairer Features**: ML pipeline that uses computer vision and large language
        models to extract latent
        demographic and portrayal information from image datasets. A novel optimization approach
        re-weights the images to reduce any present biases. Interviewed for YCombinator 2023W.
      >
      * **DSRPytorch**: From-scratch PyTorch implementation of Deep Symbolic Regression.
      Implements RL policy gradients, batching of variable-length sequences, and
      a sequence-to-PyTorch transpiler (allowing models to write PyTorch code).
      
      >
      * **GPU Optimization Code**: Implemented a conjugate gradient solver using
      CUDA. Via some clever computational tricks, my implementation beats a
      naive GPU implementation by 10x.

      >
      * **D2 BioSoftware**: Computer vision project that detects and counts
      the number of bacterial colonies present on a petri dish. Implemented using
      OpenCV and Electron; used by the McGowan Institue of Regenerative Medicine
      at the University of Pittsburgh.

      ## Miscellaneous

      >
      * I'm an avid botanist and carnivorous plant collector, specializing in the genera
        *Nepenthes*, *Heliamphora*, and *Drosera*. I
        write about my plants [here](https://www.carnivorousjourney.com/)
        and have published a book on them, available 
        [here](https://shopbritpress.org/products/nj-drosera).
      >
      * I really like the outdoors, especially skiing and mountaineering. I'm slowly
        working my way through climbing all peaks in Colorado above 14,000 feet (affectionately
        called the 14ers). I did 11 last summer!
      >
      * I enjoy playing jazz piano and drums.
